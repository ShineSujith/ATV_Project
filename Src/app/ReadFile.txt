Golden stalks of wheat sway gently in the breeze, rippling like a sunlit ocean under the vast, blue sky. The air is warm and carries the faint, earthy scent of grain, while distant hills rise softly on the horizon. A low-angle shot shows the sun glinting off each stalk, highlighting their amber tips as they dance in unison, creating a hypnotic, endless sea of gold.
